## `createDraft` and `finishDraft`

`createDraft` and `finishDraft` are two low-level functions that are mostly useful for libraries that build abstractions on top of immer. It avoids the need to always create a function in order to work with drafts. Instead, one can create a draft, modify it, and at some time in the future finish the draft, in which case the next immutable state will be produced.

Beyond that, `createDraft` / `finishDraft` could be used to express async updates to drafts:

```javascript
import {createDraft, finishDraft} from "immer"

const user = {
	name: "michel",
	todos: []
}

const draft = createDraft(user)
draft.todos = await (await window.fetch("http://host/" + draft.name)).json()
const loadedUser = finishDraft(draft)
```

Note: The above is an anti-pattern! First fetch data instead, then draft the `user`. Otherwise updates to user that happen during the async process, would be "missed" by the draft.

Note: `finishDraft` takes a `patchListener` as second argument, which can be used to record the patches, similarly to `produce`.

_Warning: in general, we recommend to use `produce` instead of the `createDraft` / `finishDraft` combo, `produce` is less error prone in usage, and more clearly separates the concepts of mutability and immutability in your code base._
