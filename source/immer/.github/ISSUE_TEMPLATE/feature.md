## ðŸš€ Feature Proposal

## Motivation

Please outline the motivation for the proposal.

## Can this be solved in user-land code?

Request that can be solved in user-land code, or are out of scope of Immer (Immer is not a general data management library!) will typically be declined. We try to stay lean and mean here.

## Example

Please provide an example for how this feature would be used.
